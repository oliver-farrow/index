<p>Hey! So I wanted to show you what a website is, but I wasn't sure how to make it perfect. So, we're going to do this together. Over time, we are going to go to shows. Whether that is a backseat lovers concert, boygenius show, or a FOOTBALL GAME. We're going to do something, and over time this website will grow and eventually you will have "avalinebooth.com" like Riley Yesno does. However, for now the website is in it's preliminary stages. With that comes some unappealing cosmetics and sloppy writing.'</p>
<br/>
<p>Here will be your first little piece about the concert we go to on June 3rd.

    <p>Here will be a piece about our show on June 21st.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>And over time, the website will be a lot more Avaline. I don't know how to explain it, you will just see it happen until it's in it's FINAL FORM. For now, this is what we have now though.'
